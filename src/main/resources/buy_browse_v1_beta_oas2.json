You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (EPID), or gtin. Or a combination of these. The following are examples of using these parameters to limit the results: The following call returns 4,330,774 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone This call, which limits the results to the category &quot;Cell Phones &amp; Smartphones&quot;, returns 142,098 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=9355 These calls, which limit results to a Samsung Galaxy S5, returns 97 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220&amp;epid=182527490 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=182527490 Controlling what is returned You can also control what is returned by using the fieldgroups field. In addition to returning items, which is the default, you can return refinements (metadata) about an item that enables you to create aspect histograms. A histogram enables users to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. You can return: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by variation aspects, such as Brand, Color, etc. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by either FIXED_PRICE or AUCTION CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by items in a category CONDITION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by item condition, such as NEW, USED, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - The default, which returns the items. When used with one or more of the refinement values above the specified refinements and all the matching items are returned. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Filtering by aspects You can use the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS returned to filter the result set using the aspect_filter field. For example: This call gets a list of the aspects pairs for the item and the dominant category (category most of the items are in). /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS This call filters the items by one of the aspect pairs returned and the dominant category. The category ID is required twice when using aspect_filter; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas} This call filters the items by multiple aspects /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas},Featured Refinements:{Adidas Match Ball} This call filters the items by multiple aspect values /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Fields filters There are also field filters you can use to refine the result set, such as listing format, item condition, price range, listing end date, location, and more. You can use multiple field filters in a single call. For a list and details of the supported filters, see search Call Field Filters. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls ( limit and offset fields) and sort query parameter that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. Restrictions This call can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions. URL Encoding Parameters and Headers As with all query parameter values, the fields parameter value and request header values must be URL encoded. For better readability, the examples in this document omit the encoding. Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Encoded Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;category_ids=20863&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId%3A20863%2CBrand%3A%7BNike%7CWilson%7D For more information about encoding, see HTML URL Encoding Reference.",

COMPACT - This returns only the following fields, which let you quickly check if the availability or price of the item has changed, if the item has been revised by the seller, or if an item's top-rated plus status has changed for items you have stored. itemId - The identifier of the item. sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item. There are two types of item revisions; seller changes, such as changing the title, and eBay system changes, such as changing the quantity when an item is purchased. This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision ID. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Changes in quantity are not tracked by the revision ID. For Example To check if a stored item's information is current, do following. Pass in the item ID and set fieldgroups to COMPACT. item/v1|46566502948|0?fieldgroups=COMPACT Do one of the following: If the sellerItemRevision field is returned and you haven't stored a revision number for this item, record the number and pass in the item ID in the getItem call to get the latest information. If the revision number is different from the value you have stored, update the value and pass in the item ID in the getItem call to get the latest information.

                "description": "This call is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as Trading, Shopping, and Finding and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot;. There is also a difference in what the item ID represents and in the format of the item ID value returned. This call lets you use the legacy item IDs retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API calls. For more information about how to use legacy IDs with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This call returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item IDs of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return information about the product of the item. For more information, see fieldgroups. Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improved the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.",
